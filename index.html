        <p>ypically, the electrical signals that make the heart pump start in the sinoatrial node, a special area of the upper right chamber of the heart called the right atrium. The signal makes both the right atrium and the left atrium contract. That action pumps blood to the lower heart chambers, or ventricles. The electrical signal then travels further down the heart, signaling the ventricles to contract.

            In atrial fibrillation, unusual electrical signals in the upper chambers interrupt this typical process. The unusual signals cause the upper chambers of the heart to contract irregularly, which makes your heart’s upper and lower chambers unable to work together to effectively pump blood.
